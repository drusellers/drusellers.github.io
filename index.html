      I also spend an inordinate amount of time working out, trying to
      stay in shape so that I can keep coding for as long as
      possible. I coded up a <a href="/prs">pr board</a> for
      myself.

        <h3>A little zen</h3>
        <p>Water is fluid, soft and yielding. But water will wear away rock,
          which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft
          and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another
          paradox: what is soft is strong.</p>

        <h3>The Grind is the Glam</h3>
        <p>Live for the moment! Do what you love. If you can
        acheive this then the grind will be glamourous. Just as it
        seems glamourous to me what rock stars get to do everyday I
        know that to them its just another day in the grind. So if
        you are going to have to do the work, it should at least be
        something you love.</p>
